<h1>The New Internet</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The internet as we know it is far from the internet of old. Today everything on the internet is interactive, and anyone can comment on almost every website that they interact with as well as interacting with the people who are responsible for those websites.
<br>
<br>
We are in what is called Web 2.0 as coined by Darcy DiNucci in 1999, but it wasn’t until Tim O’Reilly and Dale Dougherty popularized it at the O’Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in 2004. The term essentially refers to the way that websites and online intractability are presented to users. Web 2.0 differs from Web 1.0 in that the former has a much larger focus upon intractability and cooperation. There was a larger shift towards user-generated content(UGC), and it allowed for a larger amount of viewers and consumers of such media to interact with those the creators.
<br>
<br>
The chief difference was that Web 1.0 content was by and large set up in a way that simply provided content which people viewed and consumed without any sort of feedback. The shift away from such content led to the creation of many social networking sites like Myspace and Facebook, as well as the advent of weblog now commonly known as blogs through the usage of sites like Blogger, LiveJournal, and Tumblr. The content was being generated dynamically.
<br>
<br>
People with little to no knowledge of coding or computer science were able to create their own websites through the usage of systems like WordPress, which is both easy for beginners to learn and complex enough that even experienced users can make great usage of it.

Youtube was founded in 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. The trio were former PayPal employees who left the company after it was bought out by eBay. The story behind how YouTube was conceived differ based upon which of the trio one is to ask, with Chen and Hurley claiming that it was started as a video dating platform, and Karim says that the idea came out of a difficulty finding certain videos such as clips from the 2004 tsunami which devastated Indonesia and other countries along the Indian Ocean. From there, the trio, through the help of venture capital, was able to create a website that has become a ubiquitous presence on the internet, which is the

Wikipedia was founded by Jimmy Wales and Carl Sanger in 2001. The concept of the website is that it is a collaborative encyclopedia in which all the content is created by volunteers. Anyone is free to edit individual entries and create new entries. While this might not make Wikipedia the most accurate source of information, it is one that is used by people all over the world. The website is available in over 300 languages, and it is ranked the
  <a href="https://www.alexa.com/topsites">13th most visited website in the world.</a>

Google Search, or more simply just Google, is the brainchild of Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The duo launched the search engine in 1997. The search engine parses through the large amounts of public sites that are present on the internet based upon the sites ranking within its algorithm. This service allows users to find almost any content all at the touch of their fingertips. The website has since gone on to become the most used website on the internet, and the Google brand has gone on to become

One of the biggest and most popular sites of this period of the internet was Homestar Runner, which was started by The Brothers Chaps(Matt and Mike Chapman), who have created cartoons for over 20 years at this point. At the height of its popularity, the website received thousands of emails daily and garnered millions of clicks monthly. The two grew their web series through word of mouth alone as they didn’t advertise anywhere on the internet. They continue to update the website to this day. They further embodied that sort of punk rock DIY ethic that was prevalent at the time by refusing to let any advertisers on their site and survived off of the merchandise sales alone and even declined the offer to create a tv show based on their work and characters.

 “On Mondays, we get between 250,000 to 300,000 unique visitors. On Fridays and Saturdays, our smallest days, about 180,000 to 200,000,” said Mike Chapman.

“We get a few million unique visitors a month, which is pretty awesome,” said Matt Chapman.

Their work went on to become a cult phenomenon. They wore their influences on their sleeves, and they created a truly unique and deeply expanded world with a cast of oddball characters, some of which would go on to star in their own video games, be featured even have cameos in music videos. The world of Homestar Runner has a frankly strange sense of humor, one that is as deeply connected and self-referential as it is parodic. It’s a parody of the things that the brothers grew up with but without being mean-spirited in any capacity, unlike series like Family Guy or South Park. They take an approach to parody that is a lot closer to the likes of a newspaper comic which is probably why it was able to foster such a large viewership
